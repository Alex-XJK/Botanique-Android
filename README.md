The frontend Android application of our Botanique Team.

## [Botanique](https://botanique.webflow.io/)

We are a team of student entrepreneurs from the City University of Hong Kong, focusing on developing smart living planters. The team is led by Miss Chunxi LIU as the student leader and mentored by three professors, Dr. Yun Wah LAM, Dr. Daniel HOWE, and Dr. Ray LC. The venture is supported by [HKTech300](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/hktech300/), the signature innovation and entrepreneurship program of City University of Hong Kong.

## About this project

This project is our team's code repository for Android application development (According to the deputy technical head, Mr. XU, `Report 202205D`, we will develop iOS applications in the future).

Under the direction of Mr. Zhiyuan ZHANG, the technical head and implemented by Mr. Jiakai XU, the deputy technical head (frontend) at that time, we started the initial development of this part of the code and the platform building in May 2022.

## Automated quality check process

1. **Android CI**: Use the Android environment to simulate building the entire product to make sure it is bug-free and can be built correctly.
2. **Better Code Hub**: Judging the quality of the code from 10 professional perspectives, including the length of code segments, couple architecture and other aspects.
3. **Dependency Review**: Detecting vulnerable dependencies to make sure the over all security.
4. **Restyled**: Ensure that all code styles are consistent and aesthetically pleasing.
5. **ImgBot**: (When needed) Check and use intelligent algorithms to compress all images to ensure that the size of the publishing package is within a reasonable range.
